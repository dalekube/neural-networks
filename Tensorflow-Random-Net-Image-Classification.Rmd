This code demonstrates the use of many weak multi-layer perceptron neural networks in a random net to better classify images and avoid overfitting. The commonly known random forest algorithm develops many weak decision trees; however, this example shows how a data scientist can take the same approach by replacing decision trees with neural networks. Instead of saying ‘random forest’, one might call it a ‘random net’.

This example is motivated by Jason Brownlee’s article called ‘How to Develop an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models in Keras’ found here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/model-averaging-ensemble-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/. Brownlee’s example represents a bagging ensemble, whereas the random net in this publication goes a step further by randomly selecting a subset of flattened pixel features for each neural network.

## Load the data (handwritten digits from sklearn)

The handwritten digits dataset from sklearn is loaded using the load_digits() function from sklearn. The data set is documented here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html. A 10% hold-out set is defined for future evaluation after the random net and weak learners are trained. This allows us to evaluate the performance of each model using unseen observations.

```{python loadData, echo=FALSE}
# Load the handwritten digits dataset from sklearn
data = load_digits()

# Define label encoder
le = LabelEncoder()
le.fit(data.target)
n_digits = len(data.target_names)

# Separate a 10% hold out data set for future predictions
# After the random forest is trained
train_x, new_x, train_y, new_y = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, stratify=data.target, test_size=0.1)
train_x = pd.DataFrame(train_x)
new_x = pd.DataFrame(new_x)

# Data set totals
print("Training Samples =", str(len(train_x)))
print("Hold Out Samples =", str(len(new_x)))
```

## Display four random images

```{python imageDisplay}
# Display four random images from the data
# in a 2x2 plot grid
imgs = np.random.randint(0,len(data.images)-1,4)
fig, ax = pyplot.subplots(2,2)
ax[0,0].imshow(data.images[imgs[0]])
ax[0,1].imshow(data.images[imgs[1]])
ax[1,0].imshow(data.images[imgs[2]])
ax[1,1].imshow(data.images[imgs[3]])
```

## Function to train a single neural network (weak learner)

Define the function that accepts a random subset of training and testing data with a random subset of features (flattened pixel vectors) and trains an individual multi-layer perceptron network (also called a dense network). The function is called multiple times over the training process.

```{python weakLearner, echo=FALSE}
# Define function to evaluate a single MLP model
def train_model(rf_train_x, rf_train_y, rf_test_x, rf_test_y, n_features):
    
    # Encode targets
    rf_train_y = to_categorical(rf_train_y, num_classes=n_digits)
    rf_test_y = to_categorical(rf_test_y, num_classes=n_digits)
    
    # Define sequential model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(50,input_dim=n_features))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.10))
    model.add(Dense(15))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(GaussianNoise(0.10))
    model.add(Dense(n_digits))
    model.add(Activation('softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(0.01), metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    # Define callbacks
    early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor="val_loss", patience=3, verbose=1, restore_best_weights=True)
    
    # Fit model
    model.fit(rf_train_x.values, rf_train_y, epochs=100, batch_size=1000, 
              verbose=1, validation_data=(rf_test_x.values,rf_test_y),
              callbacks=[early_stop])
    
    # Evaluate model
    _, test_acc = model.evaluate(rf_test_x.values, rf_test_y, verbose=0)
    return model, test_acc
```

## Execute multiple train/test splits

Finally, we execute multiple splits and train the individual weak learners. This example trains 31 weak learners in total. A performance summary is provided as a benchmark once the training round is complete. The code calculates the average and standard deviation classification accuracy across the weak learners.

```{python fitModels, echo=FALSE}
# Execute multiple train/test splits
n_splits = 31
scores, models, cols = list(), list(), list()
for i in range(n_splits):
    
    # Select a random subset of features
    # Take the standard square root
    n = int(round(np.sqrt(train_x.shape[1])))
    rf_train_x = train_x.sample(n,axis=1)
    n_features = rf_train_x.shape[1]
    
    # Split data with 80% random bagging fraction
    rf_train_x, rf_test_x, rf_train_y, rf_test_y = train_test_split(rf_train_x, train_y, test_size=0.20)
    
    # Train the model
    model, test_acc = train_model(rf_train_x, rf_train_y, rf_test_x, rf_test_y, n_features)
    
    print('Round %.0f Complete > %.3f' % (i+1,test_acc))
    scores.append(test_acc)
    models.append(model)
    cols.append(rf_train_x.columns)
```

## Evaluate the random net on the hold out set

Consecutively evaluate the ensembled performance of the weak learners on the hold out set by adding the resulting probabilities from each model. The class with the highest probability is used as the final prediction for the random net and measured against the true class in the hold out set. This allows us to observe the increase in performance as the weak learners produce a consensus prediction.

```{python randomNetEval}
# evaluate a specific number of members in an ensemble
def evaluate_n_members(models, n_models, new_x, new_y):
    
    # Select a subset of models
    # Isolate relevant columns
    subset = models[:n_models]
    subset_cols = cols[:n_models]
    
    # Make predictions
    yhats = list()
    for i in range(0,len(subset)):        
        new_x_subset = new_x[subset_cols[i]]
        yhati = subset[i].predict(new_x_subset.values)
        yhati = np.array(yhati)
        yhats.append(yhati)
    
    # Compute bootstrapped accuracy
    summed = np.sum(yhats, axis=0)
    yhat = np.argmax(summed, axis=1)
    return accuracy_score(new_y, yhat)

# Evaluate the random net on hold out set
single_scores, ensemble_scores = list(), list()
for i in range(1,n_splits+1):
    
    # Compute ensemble score
    ensemble_score = evaluate_n_members(models, i, new_x, new_y)
    
    # Compute single score
    new_y_enc = to_categorical(new_y, num_classes=n_digits)
    new_subset = new_x[cols[i-1]]
    _, single_score = models[i-1].evaluate(new_subset.values, new_y_enc, verbose=0)
    
    # Print Results
    print('> %d: single=%.3f, random net=%.3f' % (i, single_score, ensemble_score))
    ensemble_scores.append(ensemble_score)
    single_scores.append(single_score)

# Average and STD performance for the weak learners
print('Accuracy %.3f (%.3f)' % (np.mean(single_scores), np.std(single_scores)))
```

## Performance Plot

Plot the additive performance of the random net as each weak learner is included. This can be visually compared to the individual scores of the weak learners in the same sequential order.

```{python performancePlot}
# Plot individual scores vs. ensembled scores
print('Accuracy %.3f (%.3f)' % (np.mean(single_scores), np.std(single_scores)))
x_axis = [i for i in range(1, n_splits+1)]
pyplot.plot(x_axis, single_scores, marker='o', linestyle='None')
pyplot.plot(x_axis, ensemble_scores, marker='o')
pyplot.title('Classification Performance\nRandom Net v. Individual Weak Learners')
pyplot.legend(['Weak Learners','Random Net'])
pyplot.show()
```
