# Innovative Code for Training Neural Networks

This repository holds innovative code used to train neural networks for image classification, image recognition, and other deep learning problems. The code mostly reflects the use of Python, Keras, and Tensorflow.

**Python-Keras-MLP-Random-Forest-Image-Classification:** This script bags the output of many weak multi-layer perceptron neural networks to achieve better performance and generalization. This represents a random forest--replacing the bagging of decision tree with the bagging of dense neural networks.
