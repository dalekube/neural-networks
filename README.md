# Neural Network Innovation

This repository holds innovative code used to train neural networks for image classification, image recognition, and other deep learning problems. The code mostly reflects the use of Python and Tensorflow.

**Tensorflow-Random-Net-Image-Classification:** This script bags the output of many weak multi-layer perceptron neural networks to achieve better performance and generalization. This is a variation of the traditional random forest, replacing the decision trees with neural networks.
